	title = First Sounding Rocket
	description = Congratulations on starting a new space program! Prove that you are a serious space program by completing a serious mission. You should launch a useful sounding rocket, to head above 25 kilometers and return. Just design and build a vessel, roll it out to the pad, turn up the throttle, and stage to take off! Also make sure to recover it, or just part of it. A nosecone is good. The whole rocket might be a bit harder; maybe don't do that.
	synopsis = Launch and recover a rocket	
	completedMessage = Congratulations! Your space program is off to a great start.
