	title = Tiny Tim Kick Stage Test
	description = Solid rocket motors have been used as kick stages since the very first sounding rockets. By using them as a short-burning booster, it accelerates the rocket to the speeds required for its fins to hold it steady. However, going that fast means that your rocket will slow down again because of drag, possibly moving the ullage to the back of the tank and causing feed problems for a liquid-fueled sustainer. The common solution is to hot-stage the liquid stage by igniting it with the solid rocket stage or shortly before the solid rocket burnout.
	synopsis = Test launch a Tiny Tim solid rocket motor.
	completedMessage = Congratulations! Your space program is off to a great start. Now it is time for some "rocket science" as you need to continue to go higher, faster, and farther.
